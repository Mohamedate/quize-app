# Quize-app Project
![](./screen.png)


 # This is the first project that I have just finished, using the power tools of React.

### Users experience 

-Users will have an optimal experience with the app as it will dynamically adjust its layout to fit their device screen size.
- Users should be able to view hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Users can choose the language in which they want to test their skills.
- Users can exit the app at any time they wish.
- After selecting a topic, users can choose the correct answer and continue the exam until they finish.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I have learned a lot of powerful techniques in React, such as managing state with `useReducer`, rendering components conditionally, understanding how data flows from parent to child using props, lifting up state, rendering UI based on certain actions, how to split large code to small components 
and many other fun things.

### Continued development
I am currently focusing on advanced topics in React, such as the Context API, React Router, and remote state management. These topics are crucial for building more sophisticated and feature-rich applications. By mastering the Context API, I can efficiently manage state across components and avoid prop drilling. With React Router, I can implement smooth navigation and create a multi-page user experience. Additionally, learning about remote state management will enable me to work with data from external sources, like APIs, and keep my application in sync with the backend. These advanced concepts will undoubtedly level up my React skills and open up new possibilities for creating powerful and dynamic web applications. I'm excited to continue my learning journey and apply these techniques to real-world projects!
