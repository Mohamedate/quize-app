# Quize-app Project

This is the first project that I have just finished, using the power tools in React.


### Users experience 

-Users will have an optimal experience with the app as it will dynamically adjust its layout to fit their device screen size.
- Users should be able to view hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Users can choose the language in which they want to test their skills.
- Users can exit the app at any time they wish.
- After selecting a topic, users can choose the correct answer and continue the exam until they finish.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I have learned a lot of powerful techniques in React, such as managing state with `useReducer`, rendering components conditionally, understanding how data flows from parent to child using props, lifting up state, rendering UI based on certain actions, and many other fun things.

### Continued development
